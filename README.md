#### My Projects (so far)
1. INST377 is a course I took at UMD so I have 2 repos on a [short lab assignment](https://github.com/SSankar17/inst377lab7) and a [longer lab assignment](https://github.com/SSankar17/inst377week10) I completed for that course. They showcase a variety of my skills, like calling APIs and deployment in Javascript.
2. [Air Quality App](https://github.com/SSankar17/airqualityapp) is my final project I completed alongside 2 teammates for my INST377 Web programming course.
3. [Movie Recommender Tool](https://github.com/SSankar17/movierecommendationtool) is a personal project I made recently! It utilizes a ML model to give you movie suggestions using Python.
4. [Self Playing Game of Life](https://github.com/SSankar17/FinalProject_INST326) was my final project for my Advanced Python class at UMD. I created this alongside 2 other teammates.

#### My Personal Interests!

I love reading! I'm currently reading *I Who Have Never Known Men* by Jacqueline Harpman, after I recently finished *Tender is the Flesh* by Agustina Bazterrica. I update my reading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127798076-sunny) often, and I complete the reading challenge every year. 

Apart from reading, I love listening to music! My favorite genres include jazz, pop, and r&b.
