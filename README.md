#### My Personal Interests!

I love reading! I'm currently reading *I Who Have Never Known Men* by Jacqueline Harpman, after I recently finished *Tender is the Flesh* by Agustina Bazterrica. I update my reading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127798076-sunny) often, and I complete the reading challenge every year. 

Apart from reading, I love listening to music! My favorite genres include jazz, pop, and r&b.
